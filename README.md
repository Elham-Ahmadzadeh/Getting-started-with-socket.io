# Getting-started-with-socket.io

Socket.io framework enables a communication between clients and servers. I created a button on HTML and whenever it clicks, it counts and updates on the console on the web. 

In order to update multi clients on the web. I wrote    io.emit('countUpdated', count);  istead of socket.emit('countUpdated',
count);

I tried to make it simple and understandble.
